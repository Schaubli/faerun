# Faerun
Visualizing large high-dimensional datasets.

This is the front-end of the FUn framework. A reference implementation visualizing over 10 million compunds exported from the [SureChEMBL database](https://www.surechembl.org) can be found at [faerun.gdb.tools](http://faerun.gdb.tools). The backend can be found in its own [github repository](https://github.com/reymond-group/underdarkgo).

## Getting Started
The best way to get started with Faerun is to pull the respective Docker Images.
